# Prototype
Prototype clones objects according to a prototypical instance. 

## Problem
Creating many identical objects individually is expensive, you can just clone one instead. 

## Scenario
We are trying to build many identical cars, then we can simply clone one rather than make lots of individual ones. 

## Solution
* Create a prototypical instance first then simply clone it whenever you need a replica
