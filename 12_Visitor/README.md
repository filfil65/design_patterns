# Visitor
Visitor allows adding new features to an existing class hierarchy without changing it. 

## Problem
It is sometimes necessary to add new operations dynamically to existing classes with minimal changes.

## Scenario
We have:
* House Class
* HVAC specialist: Visitor type 1
* Electrician: Visitor type 2 

## Solution
The Visitor pattern represents new operations to be performed on the various elements of an existing class hierarchy.
