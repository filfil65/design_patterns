# Decorator
Python makes decorators very easy due to its built in language features.

## Problem
The challenge here is to add new features to an existing object, dynamically at runtime, without using subclassing.

## Scenario
We start with a simple function which prints 'Hello, World!' and we want to improve the printout to make it prettier.

# Solution
Functions are also objects in Python therefore we can add new features to it using the built-in decorator feature in 
Python
* Create a prototypical instance first then simply clone it whenever you need a replica
